Partner up with Hayden in his adventures in the Afterlife, unfolding the secrets of the Forest of the Lost and Damned, as he helps the residents of the forest to settle with their mortal past, entirely made in Godot.
This is the FOSS version: all assets, maps, code and included files are released upon GPLv3 license(unless listed at [the credits file](CREDITS.md))

This repository lets youâ€¥

- Run the open source code to have a fully self-compiled FOSS version of the game
- Propose changes to be merged back into the game.
- Create modifications for this game that would otherwise be impossible.
- Use helpful code snippets in your projects.
- Create your own "total conversions" that use an entirely new set of assets.

Also, If you would like to distribute any of the original LD assets for non-LD assets, you must obtain explicit written permission from CovenFox Studios(Do feel free to @ us on Discord or the Fediverse!).
